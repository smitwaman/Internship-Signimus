## AWS Cloud

List of AWS cloud tasks covering IAM, VPC, EC2, S3, IAM roles, ALB, ASG, Route 53, Certificate Manager:

▶️1. **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**:
   - Create IAM users with appropriate permissions for different roles.
   - Implement IAM policies to control access to AWS services and resources.
   - Configure IAM roles for EC2 instances to securely access other AWS services.

▶️2. **Custom VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**:
   - Design and create a custom VPC with defined CIDR blocks and subnets.
   - Configure route tables, internet gateways, and NAT gateways for public and private subnets.
   - Implement network ACLs and security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic.

▶️3. **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**:
   - Launch EC2 instances with specific instance types, AMIs, and configurations.
   - Configure security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances.
   - Utilize EC2 instance metadata and user data for dynamic configuration and automation.

▶️4. **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**:
   - Create S3 buckets with appropriate access permissions (e.g., public, private, restricted).
   - Configure versioning, encryption, and lifecycle policies for S3 objects.
   - Implement S3 cross-region replication for disaster recovery and data redundancy.

▶️5. **IAM Roles and Instance Profile**:
   - Define IAM roles with permissions for specific tasks (e.g., S3 access, EC2 management).
   - Attach IAM roles to EC2 instances using instance profiles for seamless access to other AWS services.

▶️6. **ALB (Application Load Balancer)**:
   - Provision an ALB to distribute incoming application traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
   - Configure target groups and health checks to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
   - Enable features like SSL termination, sticky sessions, and path-based routing as per application requirements.

▶️7. **ASG (Auto Scaling Group)**:
   - Set up an Auto Scaling Group to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on demand.
   - Configure scaling policies based on metrics like CPU utilization, network traffic, or custom CloudWatch metrics.
   - Integrate ASG with ALB for dynamic scaling and load distribution.
